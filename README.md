============
asr_evalution
============

Python module for evaluting ASR hypotheses (i.e. word error rate and word recognition rate).

This module depends on my editdistance project, for computing edit distances between arbitrary sequences.


Command line usage
==================

For command line usage, see:
python editdistance.py --help

This requires Python 2.7+ since it uses argparse for the command line interface.  The rest of the code should be OK with earlier versions of Python
